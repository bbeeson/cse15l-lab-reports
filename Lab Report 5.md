vscode terminal, on course specific account

I am attempting to get the server java file to work on the ieng6 account. However whenever I try to connect to the webpage it just keeps buffering. 


**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
